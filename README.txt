js.dyntree
**********

Introduction
============

This library packages `dynatree`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of dyntree's
structure and different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`dynatree`: http://code.google.com/p/dynatree/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.dyntree``) are published to some URL.
